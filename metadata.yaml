summary: '"Outcast Robin: or, Your Brother and Mine: A Cry from the Great City" by
  L.T. Meade is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story presents a poignant
  portrayal of poverty and child neglect in urban settings, emphasizing societal failures
  and the dire consequences for innocent lives. Central to the narrative is Robin,
  a baby born into a chaotic and impoverished family, whose early life is marked by
  the absence of nurturing parental care.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced
  to the Timbs family in Blind Alley, London. The bleak circumstances of Robin''s
  birth are revealed alongside his dying motherâ€™s final wishes for her children. Immediately
  after her death, Robin is handed off, ultimately ending up in a workhouse after
  being abandoned by his alcoholic father. The opening sets a deeply emotional tone,
  vividly illustrating the harsh realities faced by the family as they struggle against
  adversity, thus foreshadowing Robin''s tumultuous journey through childhood in a
  world rife with neglect and hardship. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
